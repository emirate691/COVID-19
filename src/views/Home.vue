            <h2>Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
              available on the WHO website and through your national and local
              public health authority. Most people who become infected
              experience mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for
              others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the
              following: Wash your hands frequently
            </p>
            <p>
              Wash your hands frequently Regularly and thoroughly clean your
              hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
              water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
              alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
              Maintain social distancing Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet)
              distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
              Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
              droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
              are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
              COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
